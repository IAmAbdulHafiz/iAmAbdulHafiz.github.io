                <h3>Admin Dashboard</h3>
                <p>The Admin Dashboard is the main control center for the system. It provides administrators with a 
                    summary of total houses, tenants, and payments made within the current month. Admins can easily 
                    access various features, such as managing house types, tenants, rental payments, and generating 
                    reports.</p>

            <div class="feature">

                <h3>Tenant Management Page</h3>
                <p>The Tenant Management Page allows admins to view and manage tenant information. This page displays 
                    a list of all tenants, their current rental status, and the ability to update tenant details, manage 
                    rental agreements, and view payment history. Admins can track tenants’ outstanding balances or advance 
                    payments with ease.</p>

                <h3>Payment Management Page</h3>
                <p>The Payment Management Page enables admins to process and manage tenant payments. Admins can record 
                    monthly payments, update outstanding balances, and generate a report of all transactions for a specific 
                    month. This page also allows for automatic calculation of balances or credits for the next payment cycle 
                    based on advance payments.</p>

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>The inspiration for the Housing Allocation System came from a personal experience I had while helping a close 
                friend find affordable housing. We realized how complex and inefficient the process was, with landlords managing 
                everything manually and keeping track of payments on paper. This not only led to delays but also caused confusion 
                and errors in rent payments. I saw how a well-designed system could streamline this process and ensure fairness 
                for both tenants and landlords.<br>
                This project, which became part of my portfolio for <a href="https://holbertonschool.com">Holberton School</a>, provided the perfect opportunity to turn that 
                idea into reality. I wanted to create a solution that simplified tenant management, rental tracking, and payment 
                processing while also ensuring transparency. Over several weeks, I worked on building the system, refining the 
                architecture, and ensuring it would be scalable and secure.<br>
                It’s been a rewarding journey, as the project not only fulfills the technical requirements for <a href="https://holbertonschool.com">Holberton’s</a> program 
                but also addresses a real-world problem that affects so many people.
